HIGH COMMAND DIRECTIVE – STRUCTURAL REFORM NOTICE
<br/>
To all personnel, officers, and enlisted members:
<br/>
As part of our ongoing evolution, High Command has authorized a full restructure of our command hierarchy to better reflect our identity as a unified Canadian Army, moving away from the broader, outdated Armed Forces framework.
<br/>
Effective immediately:
<br/>
The role of Governor General is retired. In its place, we introduce the new, centralized position of Commander in Chief, who now serves as the singular highest authority within the Army command structure.
<br/>
The position of Minister of Defence is abolished. In its stead, we are implementing a refined leadership model:
Chief of Defence — holding overall strategic command of the Army.
Vice Chief of Defence — responsible for supporting the Chief and ensuring operational continuity across all divisions.
<br/>
These changes mark the beginning of a new era — one where we move as one Army, under one banner, with a command structure built for precision, strength, and unity.
<br/>
All regiments are to update their internal protocols and documentation to reflect this transition. Further operational briefings will follow.
<br/>
We are no longer a force — we are an Army.
One Command. One Mission. One Army.
<br/>
— New, Commander in Chief <br/>
@everyone <br/>
