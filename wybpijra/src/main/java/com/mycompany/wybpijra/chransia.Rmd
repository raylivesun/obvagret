:LOGO:  Update on $OXYZ Situation :LOGO: <br/> <br/>

We know this is a tough moment, and we want to reassure you:
<br/><br/>

âœ… All affected $OXYA holders will receive a 1:1 airdrop of the new token once the new contract is deployed. <br/><br/>
ðŸ“… Estimated timeline: Too soon to say â€” weâ€™ll keep you updated step by step.
<br/><br/>
ðŸ”’ <br/><br/>
 If your tokens are staked:
You do NOT need to unstake.
<br/>
Also, all the NFTs are safe.
<br/>
:LOGO:  In light of this incident, we are also reviewing the timeline for the Hunters Program Chapter 3 and MU1. Resolving the token breach and regaining community trust is our top priority. Given the current devaluation of OXYZ (approx. 90% drop), launching a new chapter now could hurt participation. Weâ€™ll involve the community in deciding whether a short postponement makes sense, and share updates very soon.
<br/>
Thanks for standing by us. Weâ€™re handling everything with security partners and will bounce back stronger. <br/>
