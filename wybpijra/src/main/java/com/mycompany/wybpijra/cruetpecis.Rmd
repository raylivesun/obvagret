🧊 Hunters, prepare yourselves — Major Update 1 is arriving at 
the end of April.​ <br/>

The Road to Genesis is about to undergo a significant transformation, introducing new layers of gameplay depth, refinement, and excitement.​ <br/>

Here’s a glimpse of what awaits in the mine and beyond:​ <br/>

💥 Expanded Arsenal: New weapon attachments, refined grenade mechanics, and evasive rolls will make combat more tactical. Sharpen your reflexes and strategies.​ <br/>

🎯 Dynamic Objectives: Missions are evolving with non-linear goals and routes, challenging your adaptability and exploration skills.​ <br/>

🔫 Weapon Variations: Diversify your loadout with new weapon options to define your combat style and dominate the battlefield.​ <br/>

🖥️ Enhanced Experience: Enjoy a cleaner UI, improved data tracking, and smoother gameplay for a refined experience.​ <br/>

⚠️ Legacy Enemies: Some familiar foes return in non-AI forms as we focus on dynamic gameplay features.​ <br/>

🎁 Mysterious Crates: Discover strange crates in the depths of the mine. Extract the right resources to craft intriguing items—rare components and hidden powers.​ <br/>

🏠 Headquarters Access: By the end of MU1, access the central HQ hub. What you bring from the mine could shape your path forever.​ <br/>

Before MU1 drops, we’ll launch the Hunter Program: Chapter III, offering a final chance to prove your worth, climb the ranks, and claim rewards before the next stage unfolds.​
<br/>
The road ahead is icy, dangerous, and full of surprises. Just the way you like it.​
