:signal13:  Security Notice – Token Incident Update :signal13: <br/> <br/>

We want to be fully transparent with you: our token is currently the target of a hack attempt. Suspicious on-chain activity has been detected, and this is a real-time situation our team is actively working to resolve. <br/> <br/>

 What we're doing: <br/> 
    •            Our entire team is mobilized and working hand-in-hand with blockchain security experts to trace the attacker and mitigate the impact. <br/>
    •            We are in direct contact with MEXC, who suspended deposit and withdrawal.
    •            As a security measure, we have also removed liquidity from Uniswap to limit further exploitation. <br/> <br/>

️ Important for all holders:<br/>
    •            It is normal if you are currently unable to transfer your tokens — this is part of the containment measures. <br/>
    •            Do not interact with any suspicious links or messages pretending to offer "refunds" or "airdrops" — they are scams. <br/>
    •            Please refrain from making any token-related transactions until we give the all-clear. <br/><br/>

We understand this is concerning, but we are doing everything in our power to protect our ecosystem and community. Your funds' safety is our top priority.
<br/>
Our tech team is fully engaged in identifying the exact cause of the attack.
We are collaborating closely with blockchain security experts and the exchanges involved.
A comprehensive protection and recovery plan is already being prepared.
<br/>
We understand how shocking and frustrating this situation is, and we’re committed to full transparency and providing regular updates here.
<br/><br/>

Thank you for your continued trust and patience.
 We will keep you updated with verified and transparent information as the situation evolves. <br/>
We’re on it — and we won’t let this go unanswered.
