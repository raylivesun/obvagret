🎮 Game Concept: <br/>
Name: Wasteseas: Tides of Ruin <br/>
🌊⚛️ Setting:<br/>
A drowned post-apocalyptic world — after a nuclear war melted the ice caps, Earth is 90% ocean. Remnants of civilization dot the waves: crumbling skyscraper islands, rusted warships, irradiated atolls, and sunken vaults filled with lost tech and mutated horrors.
<br/>
🧭 Gameplay: <br/>
Open-world co-op sailing (like Sea of Thieves) across massive oceans filled with derelict ruins, mutant sea beasts, and enemy crews. <br/>
Ship customization with salvaged tech: nuclear engines, makeshift harpoon 
launchers, mutated figureheads that give buffs, etc. <br/>
On-land exploration of ruined cities and underground bunkers in Fallout-style 
quests with moral choices, NPC factions, and loot. <br/>
Survival mechanics: radiation zones, hunger/thirst, scavenging supplies. <br/>
Faction War: Pirate clans, Vault Survivors, and mutant cults fighting over 
territory and tech. <br/>

💀 Enemies: <br/>
Mutant leviathans <br/>
Raider pirate crews with homemade power armor <br/>
Robot sea sentries from an old pre-war defense network <br/>
Ghost ships warped by radiation storms <br/>

🧰 Tone & Style: <br/>
Pirate swagger and humor, but gritty and grimy like Fallout <br/>
Rum mixed with RadAway <br/>
Shanties about nuclear winters and lost vaults <br/>
Companions with tragic backstories and snarky lines <br/>
