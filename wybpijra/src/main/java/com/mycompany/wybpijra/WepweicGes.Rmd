üïäÔ∏è | Announcement of the Passing of His Holiness Pope Francis
Greetings @everyone, <br/>

This is your Army Sergeant Major, and on behalf of the entire HQ and ownership team, I bring you solemn news today. <br/>

His Holiness Pope Francis, the 266th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, has passed away at the age of 88 on Easter Monday, following a prolonged battle with illness. He was a brave one. The first Latin American and Jesuit Pope, elected in 2013, he served the Church and humanity for 12 remarkable years.
<br/>
Pope Francis was known not only for his deep faith and humility but for his relentless dedication to the poor, the environment, interfaith peace, and justice. He led the Church through some of its most complex times, always prioritizing mercy over judgment and inclusion over division. Under his guidance, the Church became a louder voice for climate action, a shelter for refugees, and a beacon of dialogue in a divided world.
<br/>
He championed kindness, denounced corruption, and brought the papacy closer to the people ‚Äî often stepping away from tradition to embrace the everyday faithful with open arms. From washing the feet of prisoners to calling for peace in war-torn regions, Pope Francis embodied the spirit of service in every sense of the word.
<br/>
He will be deeply missed, not only by Catholics, but by all who admired his courage, wisdom, and humanity. His legacy will remain in the hearts of millions across the globe.
<br/>
As a community that values integrity, unity, and compassion, let us take a moment to reflect on the life of a man who truly gave everything to serve others. May we carry forward his message of peace and love in our own lives and duties.
<br/>
Rest in peace, Pope Francis. You were a true shepherd to your flock. üïäÔ∏è
<br/>
Signed,
:CanadianArmy: | The Entire HQ and Ownership Team.
