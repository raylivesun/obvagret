Okay, there are a couple of issues in your code, primarily a syntax error related to misplaced code.

1.  **Misplaced `printMatrix` call:** The line `printMatrix(matrix);` is placed *inside* the definition of the `rotateMatrix` method, but *outside* its actual code block (after the closing brace of the `for` loop and before the closing brace of the method itself). This is a syntax error.
2.  **Misplaced closing brace:** Related to the above, there's an extra closing brace `}` right before the misplaced `printMatrix(matrix);` call within `rotateMatrix`.
3.  **Logical Flow:** You print the original matrix in `main`, but the intention seems to be to *rotate* it first and *then* print the rotated version. The `rotateMatrix` method currently modifies the matrix but doesn't get called from `main` to perform the rotation before the intended second print.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
public class Tuawyayshy { // Consider renaming to something more descriptive like MatrixRotator

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };

        System.out.println("Original Matrix:");
        printMatrix(matrix); // Print the original matrix

        rotateMatrix(matrix); // Rotate the matrix in place

        System.out.println("\nRotated Matrix:");
        printMatrix(matrix); // Print the rotated matrix
    }

    /**
     * Rotates a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.
     * @param matrix The matrix to rotate. Assumes it's square.
     */
    public static void rotateMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        // Check for empty or non-square matrix (optional but good practice)
        if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix.length != matrix[0].length) {
            System.err.println("Matrix cannot be rotated (null, empty, or non-square).");
            return;
        }

        int n = matrix.length;

        // 1. Transpose the matrix
        // Swaps element matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i]
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Start j from i+1 to only handle the upper triangle
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int temp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
                matrix[j][i] = temp;
            }
        }

        // 2. Reverse each row
        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            reverseRow(row);
        }
        // The print call was incorrectly placed here in the original code.
        // The rotation operation itself shouldn't necessarily print.
        // Printing should be handled by the caller (e.g., the main method).
    } // End of rotateMatrix method

    /**
     * Reverses the elements of a 1D array in place.
     * @param row The array (row) to reverse.
     */
    public static void reverseRow(int[] row) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = row.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int temp = row[left];
            row[left] = row[right];
            row[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    /**
     * Prints the elements of a 2D matrix.
     * @param matrix The matrix to print.
     */
    public static void printMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0) {
            System.out.println("Matrix is empty or null.");
            return;
        }
        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            for (int value : row) {
                System.out.print(value + " ");
            }
            System.out.println(); // Newline after each row
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Changes:**

1.  **Removed Syntax Error:** Deleted the misplaced `printMatrix(matrix);` call and the extra `}` from within the `rotateMatrix` method definition.
2.  **Corrected Logic in `main`:**
    *   Added `System.out.println` labels for clarity.
    *   Called `printMatrix(matrix)` *before* rotation.
    *   Called `rotateMatrix(matrix)` to perform the rotation.
    *   Called `printMatrix(matrix)` *after* rotation to show the result.
3.  **Added Comments:** Included comments to explain the steps within `rotateMatrix` and the purpose of the methods.
4.  **Added Basic Error Handling (Optional but Recommended):** Added checks in `rotateMatrix` and `printMatrix` for null or empty matrices.

Now, the code correctly defines the matrix, prints it, rotates it 90 degrees clockwise, and then prints the rotated version.
