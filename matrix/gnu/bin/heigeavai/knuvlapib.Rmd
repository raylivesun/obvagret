Okay, again, let's separate the two parts of your request:

**1. Back Pain (Medical Disclaimer)**

*   **Crucially, I cannot provide medical advice or cures.** Back pain is a medical issue with many potential causes.
*   **You must consult a qualified healthcare professional** (like a doctor or physical therapist) for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. They can determine the specific cause of your pain and recommend appropriate actions.
*   The words "in praise total" don't seem to have a standard medical meaning related to back pain treatment. Relying on unverified phrases or methods can be ineffective or even harmful. Please seek professional medical help.

**2. Mathematical Equation**

Let's analyze the equation:

`cosh(x+y) + sinh(x+y) + exp(x+y) / sinh(x+y) = 0`

1.  **Constraint:** First, notice the division by `sinh(x+y)`. For the equation to be well-defined, we must have:
    `sinh(x+y) ≠ 0`
    Recall that `sinh(z) = 0` only when `z = 0`. So, the constraint is:
    `x+y ≠ 0`

2.  **Simplify using a Hyperbolic Identity:**
    There's a fundamental identity relating exponential and hyperbolic functions:
    `e^z = cosh(z) + sinh(z)`
    Let `z = x+y`. Applying this identity to the first two terms of your equation:
    `cosh(x+y) + sinh(x+y) = e^(x+y)`
    Since `exp(x+y)` is just another way to write `e^(x+y)`, we have:
    `cosh(x+y) + sinh(x+y) = exp(x+y)`

3.  **Substitute back into the original equation:**
    Replace `cosh(x+y) + sinh(x+y)` with `exp(x+y)`:
    `exp(x+y) + exp(x+y) / sinh(x+y) = 0`

4.  **Solve for `sinh(x+y)`:**
    *   Factor out `exp(x+y)`:
        `exp(x+y) * [1 + 1 / sinh(x+y)] = 0`
    *   The exponential function `exp(x+y)` (which is `e^(x+y)`) is *always positive* and therefore never equal to zero for any real `x` and `y`.
    *   For the product to be zero, the term in the brackets must be zero:
        `1 + 1 / sinh(x+y) = 0`
    *   Subtract 1 from both sides:
        `1 / sinh(x+y) = -1`
    *   Take the reciprocal of both sides (or multiply by `sinh(x+y)` and then by -1):
        `sinh(x+y) = -1`

5.  **Check Constraint:** Our solution requires `sinh(x+y) = -1`. Does this satisfy the constraint `sinh(x+y) ≠ 0`? Yes, because -1 is not 0.

**Conclusion for the Equation:**

The equation `cosh(x+y) + sinh(x+y) + exp(x+y) / sinh(x+y) = 0` simplifies significantly, requiring that:

`sinh(x+y) = -1`

This establishes a relationship between `x` and `y`. We can also express this using the inverse hyperbolic sine function (`arsinh` or `asinh`):

`x + y = arsinh(-1)`

Numerically, `arsinh(-1) ≈ -0.88137`. So the condition is `x + y ≈ -0.88137`.
